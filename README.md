# Student Movie Tracker

One of our clients has a requirement for a Movie Tracker application. The app allows Film Studies students to mark compulsory films as 'viewed' once they've watched them.

Thomas started building out the app using React but - as you know - he was hit by a bus. We need you to finish it by tackling each of the following tasks.

Please do so by using best practices in React and JavaScript. 

1. The genres and actors columns don't seem to be completed. Just show them as a comma-seperated list for now.

2. Add a new first column. This should have a checkbox next to each film so that they can mark it as viewed. This needs to be part of the JSON (so we can persist it, when the backend guy does the save endpoint next week), so checking or unchecking the box should update the JSON.

3. Can complete the "viewed / move total" info at the top? It's not working.

4. Please add the table sorting to the year and runtime columns.

5. Please add the table sorting to the title and director columns.
   
6. Please complete the search functionality. Think about performance.

7. If you have time, please add a delete button to each row, that deletes the film from the JSON (so we can persist it later), incase some films are removed from the syllabus.

8. Can you make the columns dynamic? Read them from the data? In case the API changes? It would be nice if, should the backend guy add another field, the table just picks it up.

Thanks!
